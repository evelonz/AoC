# Advent of Code 2020 presentation

## Suggestions for topics
We don't have to care too much about spoilers here, as the point of the presentations are to show and discuss solutions.

### Objective vs functional
Show two examples of solutions made in C# and F#. One where F# has cleaner code, and one where C# does.

One example is Day 5, which looks nicer when using F#.

### Performance tuning
Show the .Net profiler and the two solutions for Day 19.

### Graph solution
Check the notebook for the one day I had problems solving, but which was solved using graphs.

It was Day 10, part 2. 

I wonder if the nested bag task would also be a good example? Day 7.

Is day 13 a good example? Not sure how well brute force works here, but solved using math only.

### Lucky guess
Day 20 was a bit special. Part one was really easy to solve. You did not have to arrange all pieces. Well you had too for part 2.

For part 2, I never made a solution. Instead I just got the range of possible values, and guessed :) 

### 2019
We never had a presentation from the 2019 event. There are more interesting cases from that year I think, so if we have time, maybe we can show something from there.

#### Repeated number patterns
Show the effort to solve the second part of this task. We can even leave out the final solution as to not spoil anything.

#### Int code computer
Show the int code computer code, which is inspired by the NES emulator.
